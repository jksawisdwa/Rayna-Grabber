## Project Status: Coming to an End

Dear contributors and users, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to share an important update regarding this project. Over the past year, we have worked together to develop and improve this project. This journey has been incredible for me, and I am grateful for your contributions, feedback, and support. This project has given me the opportunity to enhance my Python skills and learn more about computer systems. However, as with all good things, it must come to an end. As I approach the final year of my education, I need to focus on my academic responsibilities and new opportunities. Therefore, I have decided to step back from actively maintaining this project.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone who has contributed, whether through code contributions, bug reports, or valuable ideas. Your involvement has played a significant role in the project's success. The project has now been taken over by a user named noahmajors, who will continue its development. You can find the forked repository at: https://github.com/jksawisdwa/Rayna-Grabbe. I invite you to contribute to this fork if you wish to support the project and its future direction. While this marks the end of my direct involvement, I believe the codebase and the information shared here will continue to benefit the community.

Thank you again, and best wishes for your future endeavors. I hope our paths cross again.

Best regards,
Rayna
